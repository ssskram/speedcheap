# Speed is Cheap

*"Language here is inseparable from song and story, and the songs and stories, in turn, are inseparable from the shapes and features of the land."* - David Abram, The Spell of the Sensuous

A web-based game that explores the tension between speed and deep observation, inspired by Aboriginal Australians reading the landscape from the back of a moving truck.

## How to Play

You drive a purple truck through a 3D landscape filled with natural objects. Each object contains wisdom from "The Spell of the Sensuous."

### Core Mechanics

- **Click natural objects** as you drive past them to read quotes from David Abram's book
- **Control your speed** using the slider or +/- buttons
- **Balance speed vs. wisdom**: Going faster gets you to your destination quicker, but gives you less time to click objects and fewer points when you do
- **Reach your destination** (1500km) before time runs out while collecting as much wisdom as possible

### The Trade-off

- **Slower speeds**: More time to click objects, more points per reading, but risk not reaching your destination
- **Faster speeds**: Cover distance quickly, but objects flash by too fast to click, and readings give fewer points
- **The sweet spot**: Find the rhythm that lets you gather wisdom while still completing your journey

## Controls

- **Speed Control**: Use the slider, +/- buttons, or click and drag to adjust your truck's speed
- **Reading**: Click on rocks, trees, cacti, and other natural objects to open wisdom quotes
- **Close Reading**: Click anywhere outside the quote modal to continue driving
- **Exit Game**: Use the EXIT button to return to the main menu

### Scoring
Your score reflects how much wisdom you've gathered from the landscape. The slower you're moving when you read, the more points each quote providesâ€”just like the Aboriginal elders needed more time at slower speeds to fully share what they were seeing.
